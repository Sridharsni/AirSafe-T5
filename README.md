# AirSafe-T5
This project aims to reduce miscommunication in Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications by correcting transcription errors using a fine-tuned T5 Transformer Model. The system takes noisy transcriptions from ATC voice recordings and corrects them to match standard ATC phraseology, reducing misinterpretations that could lead to aviation accidents.
